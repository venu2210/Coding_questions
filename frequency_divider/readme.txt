A frequency divider circuit reduces an input signal's frequency by a specific integer ratio (N).
In this folder, i will code for frequency / n where m is 2,4,6,8...(concept)
In this folder, i will code for frequency / n where m is 1,3,5,7...(concept)
In this folder, i will add some conceptual questions on frequency divider
